# Nature of Coding
This repo is made for two extra credits for the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. I get to choose a topic for which I get to spend 28 hours on 1 credit. I choose to follow the video series of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=6), which explains how to simulate different processes of nature in the programme [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## Project structure
There will be folders for each series of video in the main series that I get to work on in the 56 available hours. So at a maximum there will be 12 folders. Each folder will contain the designated `Processing` files.
