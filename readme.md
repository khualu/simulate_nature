# Nature of Coding
This repo is made for two extra credits for the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. I get to choose a topic for which I get to spend 28 hours on 1 credit. I choose to follow the video series of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=6), which explains how to simulate different processes of nature in the programme [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## Project structure
There will be folders for each series of video in the main series that I get to work on in the 56 available hours. There are six different main folders for each chapter in the video series. Each folder will contain the designated files. 

## Images
All images made by me can be found here: [Nature of Code Image Library](imgur.com/a/zjcvbW0). For the other images, you can find them in the corresponding links used to link them in `Markdown`.

## Afterword
This was a very informative project. I feel like I learned a lot about Processing as a tool, but also Object Oriented Programming in Java and in Javascript. An important point I learned that I definitely recognized myself in was finding ways to simulate what you want to see. I feel like I get lost a lot of times because I really want to make code work as accurately as possible. While sometimes 'cheating' your code to do what you like, might as well be the best option out there. We're designing and coding our prototypes, they do not need to be perfect.
